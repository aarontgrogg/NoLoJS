# Sticky Content

aka: Sticky Headers, Floating Sidebar

- No special HTML required, just need one line of CSS: `position: sticky;`
- Adding the CSS [`position: sticky`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/position#sticky) to any HTML element creates no-JavaScript "sticky" component.
- Note elements can be scoped within a container, so that as you scroll, one element can "replace" another as the "sticky" element.
- There are [some "oddities"](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/the-weird-parts-of-position-sticky/) that you should be aware of.
