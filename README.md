For years, JavaScript has been the web's workhorse. If HTML and CSS couldn't do something, we used JavaScript.

And while that **has** helped push the user’s experience, and HTML and CSS themselves, forward, the web is choking on JS.

As HTML and CSS gain capabilities, we should transfer any JavaScript workload possible to them.

This is an organic collection of common JS patterns that can be replaced with just HTML, CSS, and no, or very low, JS.

As HTML and CSS continue to mature, this collection should expand.

Please feel free to copy these and suggest others; Issues and PRs welcome!
