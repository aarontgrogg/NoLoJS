# Scroll Spy Nav Panel

aka: Auto-Updating Nav Tracking

- No special HTML required, adding just two lines of CSS, [`scroll-target-group`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Properties/scroll-target-group) and
  [`:target-current`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference/Selectors/:target-current), convert normal HTML deep-links into no-JavaScript automatically-updating scroll tracking.

> [!INFO]
> This is another wonderful progressive enhancement! If `scroll-target-group` and `:target-current` are not supported, everything still works just fine, simply without some fancy decoration...
